        <h2>My Personal Journey</h2>
        <p>Problems have fascinated me since I started reading. From math to social problems, I've spent hours thinking and researching them to understand their depth.</p>
        <p>In school, I represented India at a UN Conference talking about Rural Sanitation Problems and left school determined to change the world, ‚Äò1 toilet at a time.‚Äô In college, I started working on my senior‚Äôs startups only to realize how I loved users and the way they interacted with everything around them.</p>
        <p>Post college, I turned down a full-time job offer at a Fortune 500 company in my engineering domain to pursue Product Management. 3 products later, I‚Äôm glad I took that leap of faith.</p>
        <p>I now work as a full-time Product Manager at Rattle and give back to the Product Community by volunteering for The Product Folks.</p>
